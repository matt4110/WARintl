The song was rewritten and premiered at the UNGIFT conference in Vienna, Austria and performed by Canadian/US singer Eric Proffitt. 

Eric Proffitt writes and sings music that fights global issues, and inspires change. Combined with the talents of the One Voice Children's Choir, and of the arrangement by Masa Fukuda, this masterpiece is becoming an anthem for the fight against human trafficking.

The video can be downloaded and shown to youth groups, church groups, for seminars, and conferences for only 1.99 at www.ericproffitt.com.
