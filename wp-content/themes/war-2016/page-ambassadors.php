							<h1>Bill & Sandy Bennett</h1>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bennett family pastored a supporting church who took on president and founder, Rebecca McDonald, and her family at the beginning of their overseas ministry. A dream of Becky’s was to have an on-staff pastor one day at the WAR, Int’l headquarters office in the U.S. Rev. Bill Bennett has become that answered prayer. From weddings and funerals, to hospitalizations, Pastor Bill prays and supports the WAR, Int’l staff on a daily basis, allowing them to continue in their work to bring a voice to the voiceless. He is on call, with an office at WAR headquarters, in case a volunteer, shopper, or staff member needs prayer or counsel.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">He and his wife offer marriage counseling to our WAR world, as well, if desired. Pastor Bill has proven to be an invaluable member of our team, signing on checks, doing our banking, and picking up donations. He is trusted as a godly leader to assist our finance department. In compliance with not only IRS standards, but ECFA standards as well, we hold ourselves to the highest levels of fiscal responsibility, which requires a division of labor in the handling of monies. This must be a trusted "other" person. Pastor Bill is that person. He also serves as our daily security check to the public areas of our building. If there is trouble, Pastor Bill is there solving it.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bennett family works tirelessly for the WAR world, continually pouring out their time, talent, and energy to not only support staff, but safehouses and rescued women and children worldwide, as well. Through their time with WAR, Int’l, they have proven their integrity, compassion, and shepherding skills.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">For more information about the Bennett family and our Pastoral Care Ambassadors, please email us at <a href="MAILTO:info@warinternational.org">info@warinternational.org</a> or call our headquarters at (616) 855-0796.</p>

							<h1>Melody Dooley</h1>
							<p>Having been a Christian most of her life, the idea of missions always intrigued Melody. After marrying her late husband Bill Dooley in 1975, the two embarked on a decades-long ministry in Chile. When Bill unfortunately passed away in 2004, Melody was uncertain about how she would continue her missionary career. After getting involved with Women At Risk, International several years later, and getting out of an abusive second marriage, Melody began praying about the opportunity to begin working with trafficked and abused women in Chile.</p>
							<p>That ministry, after starting humbly in 2015, has now allowed Melody and her team to serve in Peru, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, and Chile. As a bilingual partner of ours, Melody is often called upon as an interpreter, as well.</p>
							<p>If you have any questions about what Melody is doing in South America, or how you can get involved with her ministry for at-risk and rescued women, please email us at <a href="MAILTO:prayer@warinternational.org">prayer@warinternational.org</a>.</p>
