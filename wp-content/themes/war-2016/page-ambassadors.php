				<h1>WAR Int'l Ambassadors</h1>
				&nbsp;

							<p>Having been a Christian most of her life, the idea of missions always intrigued Melody. After marrying her late husband Bill Dooley in 1975, the two embarked on a decades-long ministry in Chile. When Bill unfortunately passed away in 2004, Melody was uncertain about how she would continue her missionary career. After getting involved with Women At Risk, International several years later, and getting out of an abusive second marriage, Melody began praying about the opportunity to begin working with trafficked and abused women in Chile.</p>
							<p>That ministry, after starting humbly in 2015, has now allowed Melody and her team to serve in Peru, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, and Chile. As a bilingual partner of ours, Melody is often called upon as an interpreter, as well.</p>
							<p>If you have any questions about what Melody is doing in South America, or how you can get involved with her ministry for at-risk and rescued women, please email us at <a href="MAILTO:prayer@warinternational.org">prayer@warinternational.org</a>.</p>
