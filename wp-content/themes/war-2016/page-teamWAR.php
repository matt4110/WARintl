					<h2>Calling All Athletic WARriors!</h2>
					<p>Have you ever wanted to run for a cause? Now is your chance! Women At Risk, International (WAR, Int’l) will be participating in another Gazelle Girl race this spring as Team WAR.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The theme of this year’s race is “Our Sweat for their Tears.” We run to raise awareness, and to support men, women and children trapped in the bonds of exploitation around the world. This year, all funds raised will go into what we call our 911-fund. This particular fund goes toward the direct rescue of victims of sexual slavery – both here and abroad.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There will be three options for this race, a 5K, 10K and a half-marathon. If you raise over $500, you will receive a gift of some kind from WAR, Int’l, as well!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">We hope you’ll register for one of the Gazelle Girl races this spring! You can visit <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/MI/GrandRapids/GazelleGirl">this link</a>, and enter code GGWARTEAM17 at checkout for $5 off your total.

					<h2>About TeamWAR</h2>
					<p>TeamWAR is a fundraising initiative of Women At Risk, Int’l, empowering all WAR supporters to make their race count by raising awareness and funds for anti-trafficking efforts in the US.
					</p>
					<p>All funds raised by TeamWAR go directly toward the expansion of our US Training Center—a program that works to empower at-risk and rescued women in the United States. As the US Training Center grows to incorporate counseling, child care, medical services, scholarships, and more, it also becomes a model for the rescue and restoration of trafficked women in the United States.	
					</p>
					<p>We also want to empower you! Not only with the power to run, jog, or walk in a 5k or Half Marathon, but to become a circle of protection around your friends and neighbors! We humbly ask our 5K Running  WARriors to set a fundraising goal of $500 and our Half Marathon runners to raise $1,310. We would love for you to partner with us in this unique—and active!—way.
					</p>
					<p>TeamWAR, 2014 was made up of 290 runners in 11 races spanning 6 different states! Together, we raised a total of $70,849.75, enabling six local women to find dignified employment, support their families, and dream again.
					</p>
					
					<h2>The Cause</h2>
					<p>When our partners go on outreach, it’s often in the darkest corners of the earth. They gently offer wounded women a moment of peace and kindness. They look intently into the eyes of their new found friends, holding their gaze with dignity. The response is nearly immediate; when looked at as valued individuals these trafficked, abused, and exploited women finally feel "seen.” Whether amidst the humid and huddled masses of Calcutta’s red light districts, along the window-lined streets of Amsterdam, deep within the "sex tourism" destinations of Thailand, or throughout the bars and clubs of West Michigan, our question remains the same. We take their hands and ask, "What is your dream?" The response also remains the same:
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">I don't dream.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">I can't dream.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">I have no dreams.</p>
					<p>In reality, these women's lives are nightmares. They wake from fitful sleep to the recurring horror of their daily existence. Their dreams are never sweet. They live in bondage to the lie that they are powerless, worthless, hopeless.
					</p>
					<p>This is why we run this year. TeamWAR will unite this spring to raise awareness and funds for Women At Risk, Int’l’s US Training Center, offering opportunities for women to leave the bondage of sex trafficking. This growing program offers the rescued and at-risk a "hand up" not a "hand out" through dignified work, education, training, and <strong>the chance to dream</strong>, possibly for the first time.	
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Will you help us unleash these dreams? Our sweat exchanged for their tears of joy?</strong></p>
			
	
					<h2>Why We Run</h2>
					<p>We run to raise up a safe place for the wounded to run to. </p>
					<p>We run to voice the cries of the voiceless, to speak on behalf of the women and children across the street and around the world held in silence.</p><p> We run in rain, shine, snow or sleet, putting our feet down mile after mile so that we can lift them from darkness to lives of dignity and hope.</p></blockquote>
