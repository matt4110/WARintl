A few notes about this theme:

build started on May 31, 2016 by Matthew Johnson (Women At Risk, international webmaster)
This is a child theme of WordPress twenty-sixteen theme

Previously, the sites backend grew to a chaotic extent. To battle this and to be able to allow others into to backend without fear of messing much up as much of this site that could be while still keeping the site agile and flexibleÂ has been hard coded into the files. This also includes building our own javascript functionality instead of relying on plugins. This is in hopes of keeping the site easy to maintain, flexible, and protected from inexperienced users.

This theme utilizes Sass for its CSS preprocessor, so do not write to style.css or they will be overwritten the next time Sass is ran. The organization of the stylesheet follows the ideas in CSS for Growns Ups presented at 2012 SXSW Interactive. Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpFdyfs03Ug This is a very similar to SMACSS and OOCSS. If you are unfamiliar with them a quick read: https://www.sitepoint.com/css-architectures-scalable-and-modular-approaches/
Also, the bourbon Sass library has been included. This is a great light weight library that reduces repetitive processes in the CSS.
