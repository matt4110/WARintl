A few notes about this theme:

build started on May 31, 2016 by Matthew Johnson (Women At Risk, international webmaster)

This is a child theme of WordPress twenty-sixteen theme

This theme utilizes Sass for its CSS preprocessor, so do not write to style.css or they will be overwritten the next time Sass is ran. 

The organization of the stylesheet follows the ideas in CSS for Growns Ups presented at 2012 SXSW Interactive. Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpFdyfs03Ug This is a very similar to SMACSS and OOCSS. If you are unfamiliar with them a quick read: https://www.sitepoint.com/css-architectures-scalable-and-modular-approaches/

Also, the bourbon and neat Sass libraries have been included. These are great light weight libraries that enable a speedy, consistent development.
