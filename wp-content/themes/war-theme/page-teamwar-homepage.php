						<h2>About TeamWAR</h2>
						<img style="float:right; margin:10px;" src="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/teamwar-logo-sm-text.jpg"/>
						<p>TeamWAR is a fundraising initiative of Women At Risk, Int’l, empowering all WAR supporters to make their race count by raising awareness and funds for anti-trafficking efforts in the US.
						</p>
						<p>All funds raised by TeamWAR go directly toward the expansion of our US Training Center—a program that works to empower at-risk and rescued women in the United States. As the US Training Center grows to incorporate counseling, child care, medical services, scholarships, and more, it also becomes a model for the rescue and restoration of trafficked women in the United States.	
						</p>
						<p>We also want to empower you! Not only with the power to run, jog, or walk in a 5k or Half Marathon, but to become a circle of protection around your friends and neighbors! We humbly ask our 5K Running  WARriors to set a fundraising goal of $500 and our Half Marathon runners to raise $1,310. We would love for you to partner with us in this unique—and active!—way.
						</p>
						<p>TeamWAR, 2014 was made up of 290 runners in 11 races spanning 6 different states! Together, we raised a total of $70,849.75, enabling six local women to find dignified employment, support their families, and dream again.
						</p>

						<h2>The Cause</h2>
						<img style="float:left; margin-right:10px; width: 200px; height: 140px;" src="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TeamWAR-TheCause.jpg"/>
						<p>When our partners go on outreach, it’s often in the darkest corners of the earth. They gently offer wounded women a moment of peace and kindness. They look intently into the eyes of their new found friends, holding their gaze with dignity. The response is nearly immediate; when looked at as valued individuals these trafficked, abused, and exploited women finally feel "seen.” Whether amidst the humid and huddled masses of Calcutta’s red light districts, along the window-lined streets of Amsterdam, deep within the "sex tourism" destinations of Thailand, or throughout the bars and clubs of West Michigan, our question remains the same. We take their hands and ask, "What is your dream?" The response also remains the same:
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;">I don't dream.</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;">I can't dream.</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;">I have no dreams.</p>
						<p>In reality, these women's lives are nightmares. They wake from fitful sleep to the recurring horror of their daily existence. Their dreams are never sweet. They live in bondage to the lie that they are powerless, worthless, hopeless.
						</p>
						<p>This is why we run this year. TeamWAR will unite this spring to raise awareness and funds for Women At Risk, Int’l’s US Training Center, offering opportunities for women to leave the bondage of sex trafficking. This growing program offers the rescued and at-risk a "hand up" not a "hand out" through dignified work, education, training, and <strong>the chance to dream</strong>, possibly for the first time.	
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Will you help us unleash these dreams? Our sweat exchanged for their tears of joy?</strong></p>

					<h1> Team WAR 2014 Recap</h1>
					<h2>WE DID IT! WE CROSSED THE FINISH LINE!</h2>
					<p>As we wrap up the inaugural race season, we are simply amazed by the amount of support TeamWAR has received—here in our hometown and in 5 other states!!&nbsp;We are elated, honored, &nbsp;and deeply humbled to report that the <b>grand total</b> raised by our<b>&nbsp;circles of protection, influence, advocacy and action</b> was <b>$70, 849.75!!!</b></p>
					<p>When we cast our net for this campaign, we cast it wide—stepping out in faith and asking for “1 of 100 Running WARriors,” but we are thrilled to announce that <b>TeamWAR was made up of </b><b>290</b><b> runners in </b><b>11</b><b> races spanning </b><b>6</b><b> different states!</b></p>
					<p>Here are some&nbsp;<b>highlights</b>&nbsp;from TeamWAR 2014!</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Races were held in Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Maryland, Illinois, and Pennsylvania!</li>
					<li>TeamWAR had a powerful presence at our flagship race in Grand Rapids. Our jerseys sparked many awesome conversations about our cause and the women we run for! &nbsp;<a href="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TeamWAR-front-01.jpg" rel="lightbox[300]" title="Team WAR 2015"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-264" src="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TeamWAR-front-01.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426"></a></li>
					<li>A WAR board member (and brains behind TeamWAR), Kristin Cheng, told her story on WoodTV’s Eight West! Go to their <a href="http://woodtv.com/2014/04/11/get-inspired-with-gazelle-girl/">website</a> to watch her interview! Here she is posing for the paparazzi:&nbsp;<a href="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TeamWAR-front-02.jpg" rel="lightbox[300]" title="Team WAR 2015"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-266" src="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TeamWAR-front-02.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425"></a></li>
					<li>This photo of TeamWAR runners was featured on the Facebook page of Women’s Lifestyle Magazine:<a href="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Womens-lifestyle-mag-pic.jpg" rel="lightbox[300]" title="Team WAR 2015"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-267" src="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Womens-lifestyle-mag-pic.jpg" alt="Womens lifestyle mag pic" width="960" height="640"></a></li>
					<li>Over 40 people attended our Pasta Dinner to hear about the history and vision of the U.S. Training Center.</li>
					<li>One WAR staffer, Janelle Brown, has logged over 400 miles of training since the TeamWAR kickoff in January!!</li>
					<li>A Satellite Race hosted by Harvest Baptist Church in Ohio raised over 3,000 for the U.S. Training Center!<a href="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WAR-Race-2014-Workers-1024x576.jpg" rel="lightbox[300]" title="Team WAR 2015"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-260" src="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WAR-Race-2014-Workers-1024x576.jpg" alt="WAR Race 2014 Workers" width="640" height="360"></a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>We are thrilled with the results of our inaugural running season! The TeamWAR campaign is off to a GREAT start! Just imagine next year—the number of runners who will join our ranks, the amount of satellite races stretched even further across the country, and the number of voices who will raise a collective WAR cry on behalf of the women we serve!</p>
					<p>For our fellow Running WARriors:</p>
					<p>Whether you jogged, walked, skipped or crawled across the finish line– your race doesn’t have to end&nbsp;here! Now that you are a part of the WAR family, we’d love to offer a <b>banquet of ways for you to stay involved</b>—and they don’t require sneakers, blisters, or sweat! You can&nbsp;host a party (featuring jewelry made by at risk and rescued women!), form a prayer circle, attend WAR, Int’l events in your area, or any number of other ways to add more mileage to the difference you are making! Click <a href="http://warinternational.org/get-involved/">here</a> to find out more about how to get involved!</p>
					<p>As we finish this last lap together, we have a final ask. Running WARriors, we need your input! <b>&nbsp;Please click <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CPHJMDY">here</a></b><b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CPHJMDY">&nbsp;</a>to complete an online survey</b> about TeamWAR. Your thoughts and opinions are incredibly valuable and desperately needed to guide us in making TeamWAR what you, our runners, need it to be.</p>
					<p>Again, we are humbled and honored by your partnership with us. We firmly believe that every “ask” that you made, every story that you told, every mile logged, and every finish line crossed has set into motion ripples of information, influence, energy, and hope that will stretch far beyond our reach as individuals. As a<i>&nbsp;team</i>&nbsp;we can cast the message of rescue, redemption, restoration and empowerment&nbsp;<i>so much further</i>&nbsp;than we ever could alone.</p>
					<p>Our sweat for their tears doesn’t end here!</p>
					<p>We hope to see you at the starting line next year!</p>
