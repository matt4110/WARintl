				<p>An estimated 2,400 adolescents are currently for sale in West Michigan (State Department 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report). With over 400,000 people flooding into Grand Rapids for ArtPrize 2014, the risk of trafficking only increases. </p>

					<h1><strong>What is ArtPrize?</strong></h1>
					<p>ArtPrize is a large, independently organized art competition hosted in Grand Rapids, Michigan (home to WAR’s Headquarters). This event runs for 19 days with venues all throughout downtown and draws thousands of visitors and artists from all over the United States and the world.</p>

					<h1><strong>The Artist</strong></h1>
					<p><img class="alignright wp-image-11578 size-medium" src="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/artprize-scarlet-cord-pamela-alderman-300x200.jpg" alt="artprize-scarlet-cord-pamela-alderman" width="300" height="200" />Pamela Alderman has a passion for healing. Through her artwork she is able to speak about issues of mental health and social justice: raising awareness and spreading hope. According to Pamela, this passion was encouraged by international artist, Makoto Fujimura. She says, “Fujimura empowered my creativity. Since his words, I’ve learned that my work as an artist communicates to our culture the powerful healing potential of art.”</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.watercolorbypamela.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Pamela’s Paintings</strong></a> are displayed in over 20 children’s hospitals and organizations across the nation, including the Grand Rapids area where Pamela now works and lives with her family. The Grand Rapids ArtPrize competition has also become a part of Pamela’s artistic career. She first entered the competition in 2009 and continued to draw the public eye each year after. Pamela was voted into the top 100 of ArtPrize 2012 and top 50 of 2013.</p>

					<p>WAR, Int’l is excited to partner with Pamela for ArtPrize 2014. Her piece, <a href="http://pamelaalderman.com/artprize/the-scarlet-cord/" target="_blank"><em>The Scarlet Cord</em></a>, will continue her mission of hope and healing by awakening others to the reality of child trafficking and inspiring the community to take action.</p>

					<p>After hearing the story of Sweetie, a baby captive in India, <a href=" http://pamelaalderman.com/artprize/the-scarlet-cord/" target="_blank"><strong>artist Pamela Alderman</strong></a> reached out to WAR, Int’l in hopes of discovering a way to give survivors hope and dignity through her art.</p>
					<p>WAR, Int’l and Pamela will be partnering for ArtPrize 2014; informing and inspiring the community through Pamela’s art and then empowering them to take immediate action. WAR, Int’l volunteers will be available to share their passions with ArtPrize visitors and inspire them in their journey to bring dignity to wounded women and children.</p>
					<p><em>Artist’ Statement</em></p>
					<p>“<em>The Scarlet Cord</em> reveals the deception that enslaves innocent children. As visitors step inside a storage container filled with thirty doors, they enter a secret world. This dark world crosses religious and social economic borders to sell our children for sex. The twisting scarlet cord depicts the trauma bond that connects the children to their traffickers. The weathered doors represent these abused children whose youthful minds have become knotted. My art—dedicated to these suffering children tethered within the sex industry—calls for compassionate action.”</p>

					<p style="margin-right:143px;"><big>Human trafficking is a modern-day form of slavery. It is defined as the <em>“recruiting, harboring, transportation, providing, or obtaining of a person for compelled labor or commercial sex acts through force, fraud, or coercion”</em></p>

					The State Department estimates that 2,400 children are currently for sale in West Michigan alone (Trafficking in Persons 2010 Report). As over 400,000 people pour into Grand Rapids for ArtPrize 2014, the risk of trafficking only increases. Traffickers are drawn to these massive events. In anticipation of increased demand, they will likely bring young women and children to Grand Rapids to be exploited. The SOAP Project, which has partnered with WAR, Int’l is a community effort to provide opportunities for safety and escape to those trafficked in Grand Rapids.

					<h3>Already Done:<strong> The S.O.A.P Project</strong></h3>
					<img class="alignright wp-image-11588 size-medium" src="http://warinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Dark-Hotel-Hall-300x125.jpg" alt="Dark Hotel Hall" width="300" height="125" />
					
					<p>S.O.A.P<strong>.</strong> stands for 'Save Our Adolescents from Prostitution' and is a hands-on outreach to fight sex trafficking at large events &amp; in communities. S.O.A.P. was founded by author, advocate, &amp; survivor- <a href="http://www.mlive.com/living/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2010/09/human_trafficking_exploitation.html" target="_blank">Theresa Flores</a>.  </p>
					<p>Hotels are hotspots for trafficking—victims and customers are easily hidden among those who come and go from the many rooms. With over 400,000 people pouring into Grand Rapids for ArtPrize 2014, hiding victims and finding customers will only become easier. By labeling soap with the human trafficking hotline and donating it to local hotels, S.O.A.P. offers a life-line to trafficking victims. WAR, Int’l will be partnering with The S.O.A.P. Project this September; raising funds for the soap and gathering an army of volunteers that will team up to protect Grand Rapids.</p>
					
					<p><strong>September 6<sup>th</sup>:</strong> a SOAP success</p>
					<p>Over 150 people joined WAR, Int’l and GVSU’s IJM for the SOAP project on September, 6th. Together, they blanketed the city of Grand Rapids in preparation for ArtPrize, 2014. 120 hotels, 6 strips clubs, and several local bars gladly accepted our life-saving soaps and coasters, some even asked to partner with us for future events. If you would like to receive information about how to protect women and children from the risks of trafficking, email info@warinternational.org. Thank you for being a circle of protection around those at-risk!</p>
