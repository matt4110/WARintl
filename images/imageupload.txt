Uploading Images To Rotators

1. Open FTP program of your choice

2. Connect to FTP Server with the following information
FTP Username: ftpuser@warinternational.com
FTP Password: WAR!1234
FTP Server: ftp.warinternational.com
FTP Server Port: 21

3. Once connected you will see a series of folders and files...

bridalrotate - Photo Limit of 20 images - Rotator on Bridal page
category - Images for the main store category pages
giftspage - images for the gifts we love page (no limit - has paging funcitonality)
homerotate - Homepage rotator - Recommend no more than 5
lookbookrotate - Photo Limit of 20 - Look Book Rotator
splashpages - Special category images (Wedding, Lookbook etc.)
wedpages - Seasonal wedding pages - works like Gifts We Love Gallery

4. Rename images to overwrite current images **Save A Copy Of Current Images First**
(If you do not rename images, then code changes will need to be made. I can show you where if you want to do that.)


5. Make Sure your images are the right size... ALL IMAGES MUST BE 72 DPI NOT 300...
Bridal - height must be 400pixels and the photo must be vertical
Lookbook - height must be 400pixels and the photo must be vertical 
Gifts we love and Wedding Seasonal - * 2 sizes required * 75x75 and height must be 500pixels and vertical
Homepage - 600 x 400 pixels

6. Once the images are formatted and named correctly, you can upload them to the correct folders.

7. If you are overwritting previous images - they should just appear in the right spots.

If you did not rename them, now you need to go into the code and make any necessary changes there.
If you need to make changes to where the links lead to, then you must make those in the code areas as well.
